# Deployment to AWS

## Prerequisites
- An AWS account.
- A registered domain (you can use Route 53 or another domain registration service).
- AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed.

## Steps:

### Build Your React App:
Before deploying, you need to create a production build of your app.
```bash
npm run build
```
## Create an S3 Bucket:
Navigate to the AWS Management Console and open the Amazon S3 dashboard. Create a new bucket with the name of your domain (e.g., `mobenh.com`).

## Configure the S3 Bucket for Static Website Hosting:
1. Open your S3 bucket and navigate to the **Properties** tab.
2. Scroll down and click on **Static website hosting**.
3. Choose **Use this bucket to host a website** and enter `index.html` for both the Index and Error documents.
4. Save the changes.


## Request an SSL Certificate using ACM:

1. Open the AWS Certificate Manager and request a public certificate.
2. Enter your domain name and follow the steps to validate the domain (either through email or DNS validation).
3. Once validated, the certificate status will change to **Issued**.

## Setup CloudFront:

1. Navigate to the CloudFront dashboard and create a new distribution.
2. Choose your S3 bucket as the origin.
3. Under "Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)", enter your domain name.
4. For "SSL Certificate", choose "Custom SSL Certificate" and select the certificate you created in ACM.
5. Save the distribution. Note down the CloudFront Distribution Domain Name (e.g., `d12345abcdegh.cloudfront.net`).

## Configure Route 53:

1. Open Route 53 and navigate to your domain's hosted zone.
2. Create a new record set. For the record type, choose A â€“ IPv4 address.
3. For the Alias target, enter the CloudFront Distribution Domain Name from the previous step.
4. Save the record set.

## Wait for Propagation:

- It might take some time for your DNS changes to propagate. Once propagated, visiting your domain (e.g., `mobenh.com`) should display your React portfolio app served through CloudFront.

## Important Notes:

- Ensure your S3 bucket permissions allow public reads for your app to be accessible.
- After updating your React app, remember to rebuild and re-upload it to the S3 bucket. Also, consider invalidating the CloudFront cache to see the updates immediately.
